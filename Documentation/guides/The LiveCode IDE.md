# The LiveCode IDE

## Introduction

This guide details the main components within LiveCodes Integrated
Development Environment (IDE). The development environment contains all
the features you need to quickly create a professional application. The
Application Browser allows you to find your way around your application
as you develop it. The Properties Inspector allows you to set appearance
and basic behaviors. The Script Editor allows you to add code to each
object in your application. In addition to these standard tools, the
Message Box provides a mini command-line that allows you to develop
aspects of your application automatically or to test out your
application’s code and functionality.

## The Menu Bar

### The File Menu

The File menu contains commands to open, close and save files; print;
and incorporate files into your stack.

| Menu Item | Action |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **New Stack**                          | Opens a cascading menu you can use to choose a stack type to create. When you save the stack, LiveCode asks for a file name and location.                                                                                                                 |
| **Default Size**	 					 | Creates a stack at the default size (400x400)																																																			 |
| **Predefined Size**					 | Creates a stack at the predefined size specified																																																		     |
| **Script only Stack**					 | Creates a stack to be used for script only. You will be prompted for a stack name, and the script editor for the new stack will launch automatically																										 |
| **New Substack of (main stack name)**  | Creates a new untitled stack in the same file as the active main stack. When you save the substack, it is saved in the main stack’s file. This item is disabled if the active window is not a main stack.                                                 |
| **Open Stack...**                      | Opens the main stack whose file you select. If you select a HyperCard file, it is automatically converted into a LiveCode main stack.                                                                                                                     |
| **Open Recent Stack**                  | Opens a cascading menu containing the names of the 30 main stacks you have most recently closed. Choose a name to open the stack. You can change the number of items displayed using Preferences.                                                         |
| **Close**                              | Closes the active window. This item is disabled if no window is open.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Close and Remove from Memory...**    | Closes the current stack and all stacks in the same stack file as the current stack, and removes all stacks in the file from memory. This item is disabled if the active window is not a user stack.                                                      |

| **Suppress Errors**       | Prevents display of the error window when LiveCode encounters a script error. |
| **Suppress Messages**     | Prevents system messages (such as openCard and closeCard) from being sent during normal navigation. This option will also cancel any currently *pending* messages. |
| **Suspend Development Tools** | Hides LiveCode's menus, palettes, and other parts of the development environment, so that you can preview how your application will look and behave as a standalone, outside the development environment. |

> **Caution:** Suppressing errors will cause your scripts to fail 
silently instead of giving an error message in the event LiveCode 
encounters an error.

> **Tip:** To also suspend LiveCode libraries, hold down the Shift key 
while choosing the **Suspend Development Tools** menu item.

### The View Menu

The View menu contains commands to move around the current stack and to

## The Property Inspector

The Property Inspector allows you to view and edit the properties for
any selected object. Properties control how an object looks and some
aspects of an object’s behavior. The Inspector can be accessed by double
clicking on a selected object, from the toolbar, from the *Object* menu
and from context sensitive menus.

| **Lock icon**     		| The lock icon locks the Inspector to the object currently being inspected. Once locked, the Inspector will not update when you change selection or switch to *Run* mode by choosing the *Browse tool*. This allows you to used a locked Inspector to change an object’s properties while interacting with your project. Selecting another object and choosing Inspect will create another Inspector to inspect the new object. You can use this facility to compare the properties of two objects. |
| **Pane Selector** 		| This menu allows you to access each of the different panes within the inspector for a given object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## The Script Editor

The Script Editor within LiveCode has been designed specifically for
LiveCode coding. It includes features to help make code more
understandable. These include code indentation and color coded syntax
highlighting, as well as other integrated tools such as a Debugger and
syntax Dictionary. You can access the Script Editor for an object by
selecting the object then choosing Script from the Tool bar. The Script
Editor is also available from the Object menu, and from a number of
other context sensitive menus detailed elsewhere in this guide. Each of
the Script Editor's components are outlined below.

![](images/image39.png)

### Main Script Area

Display and edit scripts in this area. For more details on how to write
a script, see the section on Coding in LiveCode. The Script Editor will
colorize and format scripts automatically. When typing press tab to
manually format the script. Press Enter (on the numeric keypad) to
compile the script. Press Enter again to close the Script Editor.

> **Note:** It is not necessary to close the Script Editor to run a
> script, all that is required is that the script is applied using the
> Apply button.

### Breakpoints Area

Click next to a line of script to set or remove a breakpoint. A
breakpoint specifies a point at which script execution should pause and
the debugger be loaded. For more details, see the section on Debugging.

### Apply Button

Compiles the script instantly. Any syntax errors will appear in the
Error Display and the script will not compile. A compiled script is not
saved until the stack that contains it is saved.

Press *Enter* (on the numeric keypad) to activate the Compile button.
Press *Enter* again to close the Script Editor.

Note that *none* of the message handlers within the script will be
available if there is a Script Error during compilation, as none of the
script will have compiled.

### Errors Pane

Compile and execution errors will appear here. Double click the icon
next to the error details to highlight the line the error occurred on in
the script (if applicable).

![](images/image40.png)

### Handler List

The handler list displays all the functions, commands and handlers which
are part of the current script. When a handler name is clicked, the
script will jump to that handler.

The currently displayed list of handlers can be filtered by typing in 
the filter box below it.

### Documentation Pane

The Script Editor also has a built-in syntax dictionary. When this tab 
is active a summary of the dictionary entry for the keyword which you 
are currently typing will be displayed. The full dictionary entry can be
viewed by clicking Launch Documentation. Alternatively you can choose to
view the entire entry in place by toggling the Full Document check box
at the bottom of the documentation pane.

![](images/image41.png)

### Search Results Pane

When you perform a 'find all' operation the results will be displayed 
under this tab.

![](images/image42.png)

### Script Tabs

When multiple scripts are open they will appear as tabs in the Script
Editor. Right clicking on the tabs brings up a menu which allows a tab
to be moved to a new window, closed, or kept while closing all other
tabs. Clicking a tab will bring up the script it represents.

## The Debugger

The Debugger helps you track bugs and understand code, by allowing you
to pause the execution of your programs or step through them line by
line. You cause execution to pause by setting breakpoints. When you run
your script, execution will pause at a breakpoint and you will be able
to observe or edit variable values, continue execution or set another
breakpoint later in the code. Each debugger feature is outlined below:

![](images/image43.png)

### Continue

When in debug mode, the Continue button will start running the code from
the current position. The program will run until the end is reached or
another breakpoint is found.

When you are not in debug mode, the continue button can be used to
execute a handler. When you press it, a dialog will appear asking which
handler you would like to call and, if applicable, which parameters
you'd like to pass. On clicking OK the Script Editor will call the handler
you specified. It will also remember the handler for next time. To
change the handler called later, choose Entry Point… from the Debug menu.

### Stop Debugging

Will halt execution at the current point and stop debugging. You will
then be able to edit the script.

### Show Next Statement

The Show Next statement option will return the debugger to the currently
executing statement. This is useful if you have switched tabs or
scrolled during debugging.

### Step Into Next Statement

Use Step Into to execute the next statement. If the next statement is a
command or function ‘Step Into’ will jump to that function or command
allowing you to execute it line by line.

![](images/image44.png)

### Step Over Next Statement

Use Step Over to execute a command or function call without stepping
through it line by line. The code within the handler will run at full
speed and execution will pause on the line after the handler call.

![](images/image45.png)

### Step Out

The Step Out function allows you to exit a command or function that you
have previously ‘stepped into’. When selected, the rest of the current
handler will run and execution will pause on the line after the handler
call. This is useful to avoid stepping through a long command or
function line by line when you have identified that the error you are
looking for is not within that command or function.

![](images/image46.png)

### Debug Context

The Debug Context shows you the path of execution up to the current
statement you are paused on in the debugger. This allows you to identify
where you are in your program and which handlers called the current
handler you are in. Changing the debug context allows you to view
variables from different parts of the program. Use this feature to find
an erroneous command call or a call where wrong parameters were used.

### Variable Watcher

The Variable Watcher tab allows you to examine the value of variables
within your program while it is executing. As you step through your code
these values will be updated. The variable name is shown in the left
column and its value adjacent on the right. If a variable's value is too
large to be displayed in the pane it will have a magnifying glass next
to it. Clicking this will bring up a watch window which allows the
variable's value to be changed. Variables can also be edited by double
clicking on their value in the variable watcher.

> **Tip:** You can see the value of a variable by moving the mouse over
> the variables’ name in the script field while debugging.

### Breakpoint Management

Use breakpoints to specify where to pause execution in the debugger. You
set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter, or by right clicking in the
Breakpoint Manager at the bottom of the Script Editor and selecting “New
Breakpoint”. Each breakpoint is associated with a line of code and
execution is paused when that line is reached. Alternatively, a
condition can be assigned to the breakpoint. In this case, execution
will only pause if the condition is true when the line is reached.

![](images/image47.png)

> **Tip:** To see a list of all the breakpoints within a stack,
> including the script they are in, which line they are on, and whether
> there is a condition attached, click the Breakpoints Manager at the
> bottom of the Script Editor. The check box to the left of each
> breakpoint can be used to enable or disable the breakpoint. Double
> click a breakpoint to go to that line in the associated object's
> script. To edit a breakpoint, including adding a condition or changing
> the line number, click the pencil icon. This can also be done by
> right-clicking on the breakpoint, either in the Breakpoints Manager,
> or the Script Editor's gutter.

![](images/image48.png)![](images/image49.png)

The Breakpoint Manager also allows you to set watches. These are
associated with variables rather than lines of code and will pause
execution when the value of the variable you are watching changes.
Alternatively, if the watch has a condition attached, execution will
only pause if, when the variable's value is changed, the condition is
true. To add a watch, right click in the Breakpoint Manager and choose
“New Breakpoint”.

## The Script Editor Menubar

The Script Editor menubar contains commands to help you edit scripts.

### The File Menu

The File menu contains commands to print a script or close the Script
Editor, with or without saving changes to the script.

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Compile** | Compiles the current script.                                     |
| **Save**    | Saves the current stack.                                         |
| **Close**   | Closes the current script.                                       |
| **Print**   | Prints the current script.                                       |
| **Quit**    | Exits LiveCode. Will prompt you to save your work if applicable. |

### The Edit Menu

In addition to the standard commands to select, cut, copy and paste
text, the Edit menu contains the following, script-specific commands:

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Revert**            | Takes any changes which haven't been compiled, and removes them from the current script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Comment**           | Places a comment character at the beginning of the selected text. If more than one line is selected a comment character is placed at the beginning of each line.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Uncomment**         | Removes comment characters from the selected text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Quick Find**        | Opens the “find” field within the Script Editor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Find and Replace…** | Brings up the Script Editor's find and replace dialog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Go**                | Brings up a dialog box which lets you enter a line number to jump to in the script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Variable Checking** | Variable checking causes LiveCode to perform a stricter check of your scripts. Using any variable without declaring it first, or using a literal string without encloning it in quotes causes a compile error. This behavior can be useful in tracking down certain subtle problems such as misspelling a variable name. |

### The Debug Menu

The Debug menu contains commands to aid in debugging scripts:

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Show Next** | Highlights the next line of code to be executed. This is useful if you have changed tab or scrolled your script during debbuging. |

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|---------------|--|
| **Step Into** | Executes the next line of the handler being debugged. If the next line is a call to another handler, this command steps into that handler. This menu item is disabled if the debugger is not running. |

> **Tip:** Press F11 to step into the next line.

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Step Over** | Executes the next line of the handler being debugged. If the next line is a call to another handler, this command steps over that call, skipping it and staying within the current handler. |

> **Tip:** Press F10 to step over the next line.

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Run** | Resumes normally executing the handler being debugged, starting from the current line. |

> **Tip:** Press F5 to activate the Run button.

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|-----------|-------|
| **Abort** | Stops running the handler being debugged. |

> **Tip:** Press control-period (or command-period) to activate the
> Abort button.

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Toggle Breakpoint** | Adds/removes a breakpoint from/to the currently selected line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Variables**         | Changes the tab view at the bottom of the Script Editor to the Variable Watcher tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Breakpoints**       | Changes the tab view at the bottom of the Script Editor to the Breakpoint Manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Entry Point**       | Lets you define which handler execution should begin at when debugging a script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Script Debug Mode** | If this item is checked, the debugger is enabled: the execution of the program will pause when a breakpoint is encountered during script execution, and you can enter the debugger when an execution error occurs. If unchecked the debugger is disabled. For more details, see the section on Debugging. |

### The Handler Menu

The Handler menu contains a list of all handlers in the current script.
Choose a handler to go to that handler in the script.

### The Window Menu

The Window menu contains the names of open script editor windows.

### Autocomplete

While typing in the script editor a filtered list of available completions
will appear below the selection. Use the following keys to navigate the
completion list:

- tab - apply the completion
- up arrow - move up the list
- down arrow - move down the list
- right arrow - move to the next placeholder field
- left arrow - close the completion list

Moving the mouse will hide the completion list to avoid it remaining in
place over an area you would like to select. Completions include
placeholder fields which you can navigate with the tab key.

## The Message Box

The Message Box is a command line tool that allows you to run scripts or
perform automated editing operations. It allows you to try out short
scripts, test parts of your program, provides a convenient output window
for debugging and can be used for editing and setting properties.

> **Tip:** The Message Box is one of the more useful components in
> LiveCode when you are starting out and wanting to try out simple
> scripts. You will find you can try out many of the script examples in
> this User's Guide or in the getting started materials on our website
> simply by copy-pasting them into the Message Box.

The message box has the following modes:

**Single Line** – execute single line and short scripts

**Multiple Lines** – execute multiple line scripts

**Global Properties** – view and edit global properties

**Global Variables** – view and edit global variables

**Pending Messages** – view, cancel and edit pending messages

**Front Scripts** – view and edit frontScripts

**Back Scripts** – view and edit backScripts

| **Stack selector** | Select a stack to work on. Prior to executing any script the *defaultStack* will be set to the stack displayed in this menu. By default the Message Box will choose the front most editable stack. The menu is updated whenever you change the front most stack or click on the Message Box. You can use this menu to choose an alternative open stack. For example, running the following script in the command area of the single line message box:<br><br>`put the number of controls`<br><br>Would place the number of controls in the current card of the *stack displayed in the menu*, into the results area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Lock icon**      | This option prevents the Stack selector from updating automatically when you change stacks. Use this option if you want to run a number of commands on a specific stack regardless of which stack is currently in front.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Message Box settings

| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|
|--------------------|--------|
| **Tab display style**  | Controls whether to use icons or text for the mode selections. |
| **Header/Footer size**  | Controls how large the mode selector icons and footer action icons are. 																																																			 |
| **Auto update pending messages**  | Toggles whether the pending messages as displayed in message box in pending messages mode are updated automatically or manually. 																																																			 |
| **Select intelligence object**  | The Message Box will attempt to auto complete the typing of a name of an object property, resulting in putting the contents of that property into the results area. You can choose whether the auto-complete should attempt to use the currently selected object, or the object directly underneath the mouse. For example, with an object selected, entering:<br><br>`width`<br><br>Will result in:<br><br>`put the width of the selObj`<br><br>The width of the currently selected object will be placed in the results area. The `selObj`will be substituted with the `mouseControl`if you choose this option. In the example above, that would result in the width of the object underneath the mouse being placed in the results area instead. For more details on the `selObj`function or the `mouseControl`functions, see the LiveCode Dictionary.                                                   |

### Single and Multiple Line Modes

Use the Single and Multi-Line modes to execute short scripts.

### Global Properties

The Global Properties mode allows you to view and edit all global
properties. Scroll to select a property from the list on the left and
select it to view or edit it. Typing a portion of the property name into
the Filter field at the top will filter the list of properties. Changes
to global properties take effect immediately. If a property is ‘read
only’ this will be indicated when you select it and editing it will have
no effect. For more details on Global Properties, see the section on
*Global Properties.*

### Global Variables

The Global Variables mode allows you to view and edit all global
variables. Environment variables are shown first, followed by other
variables. Scroll to find a variable from the list on the left and
select it to view or edit it. Typing a portion of the variable name into
the Filter field at the top will filter the list of variables. Changes
to global properties take effect immediately. The Show LiveCode UI
Variables is an advanced option, discussed in the section on Editing the
LiveCode User Interface. For more details on Global Variables, see the
section on *Global Variables*.

### Pending Messages

The Pending Messages mode allows you to view all the current timer based
messages that are pending. This is the same as the global property the
**pendingMessages**. You can select a pending message to edit its script
or cancel it.

> **Tip:** You can cancel all current pending messages using the
> **Suppress Messages** button on the toolbar.

Pressing update refreshes the list with the current list of pending
messages. The Auto Update mode refreshes the list continuously. Note
that the Auto Update takes place every 200 milliseconds. If your
messages fire more quickly they may not be displayed. For more details
on Pending Messages, see the section on *Timer Based Messaging*. The
Show LiveCode UI Messages is an advanced option, discussed in the
section on *Editing the LiveCode User Interface*.

### Front Scripts & Back Scripts

These modes list all the scripts currently available as libraries at the
front or back of the message path. This is the same as the global
properties the **frontScripts** and the **backScripts**. Select a front
or back script to remove it or edit its script. For more details on
library scripts, see the section on *Extending the Message Path*. The
Show LiveCode UI Scripts is an advanced option that displays all of the
libraries used by the LiveCode IDE. This is discussed in the section on
*Editing the LiveCode User Interface*.

### Stacks In Use

This mode is the same as the Front and Back scripts mode, except that it
displays the **stacksInUse** global property. You can also add a stack
directly using the Add button.

## The Toolbar

The main toolbar provides easy access to commonly used functions.

Figure 11 – The Main Toolbar

For details on what each toolbar icon does, see the section on the Menu
Bar (above).

To hide and show the text or icons on the tool bar, use 
**View -\> Toolbar Text** and **View -\> Toolbar Icons**. To hide the 
Toolbar completely, uncheck both options.

## Find and Replace

The Find and Replace dialog allows you to search your entire
application, a portion of the application, multiple files in a
directory, or stacks specified in your application’s **stackFiles**
property. You can search for object names, scripts, field & button text,
custom properties, and other properties. After performing a search you
can replace the search term with a replacement term, either in all of
the results or on a selection of the results.
