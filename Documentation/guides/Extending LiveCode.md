# Extending LiveCode

## Introduction

LiveCode 8.0 is the most exciting release in the history of the technology. It provides a 
simple way to extend the functionality or control set of LiveCode.

Our focus in LiveCode 8.0 is extensibility. You can now build and share widgets (custom 
controls) and libraries that are treated by LiveCode as engine level elements.

LiveCode 8.0 can be thought of as a version 7.0 with a new module allowing extensions to 
be plugged into the engine. As a result, 8.0 should be as functional and stable as 
LiveCode 7.0.

This guide will take you through the process of installing and using these new widgets and 
libraries and for the adventurous among you, provide a guide to building and sharing your 
own extensions. 

## LiveCode Builder Extensions

To make it possible to create extensions and plug them into the LiveCode engine we've 
created a new flavour of our language called ***LiveCode Builder***. LiveCode Builder 
looks a lot like LiveCode Script so should feel familiar for any seasoned LiveCode 
developer. There is lots of new syntax which exposes parts of the LiveCode engine that 
were only previously available to those who were skilled c/c++ developers.

To learn more about LiveCode Builder and creating extensions, read on.

> *Warning:* It is important to stress right at the start that 
> ***no aspect of LiveCode Builder should be considered final***. 
> ***Every piece of syntax in LiveCode Builder is subject to change***.

### Creating LiveCode Builder Extensions

We have provided a new "Extension Builder" stack to help make development and packaging of 
extensions as easy as possible. 

> **Note:** LiveCode Builder is a different flavour of LiveCode so it is 
> not possible to edit LiveCode Builder scripts in the main LiveCode 
> Script IDE.

### Extension Builder

Open the "Extension Builder" from the tools menu:

	Tools > Extension Builder

![Extension Builder plugin](images/extensions-plugin-overview.png)

1. Shows the currently selected extension. 
2. Data that the builder was able to parse from the directory such as icons, resources, API's the user guides.
3. Console: Shows status, error and log messages.
4. Test: Creates a stack, compiles the extensions and creates an instance.
5. Script: Opens the lcb script in an external default editor.
6. Install: Installs the extension into the IDE
7. Uninstall: Uninstalls the extension from the IDE
8. Package: Creates a .lce package which can uploaded to the extension store. It is placed in the extension directory

> **Note:** A great way to get started is to tweak the script of one of 
> our widget examples.

Using the selection dropdown (1), you can select the extension you wish 
to develop or click the "open" icon in the header back to locate an 
extension you've not loaded before. 

### Create your own simple widget
The main difference between widgets and libraries is that a widget draws 
to a pre-existing canvas. Apart from that, the authoring process is much 
the same for both extension types.

#### Create a .lcb file
We recommend using the Atom text editor, available at https://atom.io/. A LiveCode package 
is available which provides some colorization as well as indentation. 
If you prefer to use TextWrangler, there is a colorising script [here](https://github.com/livecode/livecode/tree/develop/contrib/TextWrangler). 
It should be placed in /Application Support/TextWrangler/Language Modules/

Start by creating a plain text file in a new directory and save it to disk with the 
extension "lcb":

	/Desktop/widgettest/main.lcb

> **Note:** The extension builder currently relies on there being only 
> one ***.lcb*** file in a given directory.	

#### Declare Type and Identifier
Start by declaring the type of extension, either "widget" or "library" followed by your 
identifier (See "Select A Developer ID" below).

	widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCircle
	   ## Code for your widget
	end widget

This is the unique identifier by which your extension will be referred to by the LiveCode 
Engine.

> **Note:** All LiveCode authored widgets are in the application package 
at /Tools/Extensions/. To play with one of these extensions we recommend 
copying the folder from the application package to your desktop and 
loading it from there. Changing the extension identifier in the source 
code will ensure it doesn't conflict with the existing extension.

#### Declare Metadata
Next, provide metadata to help LiveCode display your widget correctly 
in the IDE and in the online portal.

	widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCircle

	metadata title is "My Pink Circle"
	metadata author is "Benjamin Beaumont"
	metadata version is "1.0.0"

	end widget

#### Importing libraries
The LiveCode builder syntax is broken down into **modules**. There are 3 classes of module:

Type|Description
---|---
Default|These modules are part of LiveCode builder and are included by default. Their syntax is always available to you as a LiveCode developer.
Optional|These modules are created and distributed by LiveCode Ltd and must be imported by the extension developer in order to make use of their syntax.
Custom|These modules are created and distributed through the online portal and must be imported by the extension developer in order to make use of their syntax.

LiveCode builder contains the following modules:

Module|Type|Description
---|---|---
com.livecode.canvas|Optional|Provides the syntax and types for 2D drawing allowing developers to draw to a canvas. Required if creating a widget.
com.livecode.widget|Optional|Contains syntax specific to widget building such as "my width" and "the mouse position".
com.livecode.engine|Optional|Contains syntax for all extension building such as "dispatch" and "log".
com.livecode.arithmetic|Default|Contains syntax for basic mathematical operations.
com.livecode.array|Default|Contains syntax for operations on arrays.
com.livecode.binary|Default|Contains syntax for operations on binary data.
com.livecode.bitwise|Default|Contains syntax for bitwise logical operators.
com.livecode.byte|Default|Contains syntax for operations on byte chunks.
com.livecode.char|Default|Contains syntax for operations on char chunks.
com.livecode.codeunit|Default|Contains syntax for operations on codeunit chunks.
com.livecode.date|Default|Contains syntax for accessing the date and time.
com.livecode.file|Default|Contains syntax for file I/O operations.
com.livecode.foreign|Default|Provides the type bindings for foreign types.
com.livecode.list|Default|Contains syntax for operations on lists.
com.livecode.logic|Default|Contains syntax for logical operators.
com.livecode.mathfoundation|Default|Contains syntax for foundational mathematical operations.
com.livecode.math|Default|Contains syntax for mathematical operations.
com.livecode.sort|Default|Contains syntax for sorting operations.
com.livecode.stream|Default|Contains syntax for stream I/O operations.
com.livecode.string|Default|Contains syntax for operations on strings.
com.livecode.system|Default|Contains syntax for accessing system information.
com.livecode.type|Default|Contains syntax for general operations on types.
com.livecode.typeconvert|Default|Contains syntax for conversions between types.
com.livecode.unittest|Default|Contains syntax for unit testing LiveCode Builder programs.

> **Warning!** Module names are subject to change.

The new LiveCode dictionary has a full list of all available syntax as well as the module 
each belongs to. As a general rule we recommend importing all three optional module 
whenever developing widgets.

	widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCircle

	use com.livecode.canvas
	use com.livecode.widget
	use com.livecode.engine

	metadata title is "My Pink Circle"
	metadata author is "Benjamin Beaumont"
	metadata version is "1.0.0"

	end widget

#### Core Handlers

There are three core handlers that any widget developer should implement:

Handler|Description
------|------
OnPaint|The *OnPaint* message is sent to your widget whenever LiveCode requires it to redraw. The performance of your widget is tied primarily to this handler and should be kept as efficient as possible.
OnCreate|The *OnCreate* message is sent to your widget when it is first created by LiveCode. This can be used to initialise default data and where applicable, reduce the burden for calculating constants etc in the onPaint handler.
OnGeometryChanged| The *OnGeometryChanged* message is sent when the control is changed in size.
OnSave| The *OnSave* message is sent when your widget is about to be destroyed and enables the widget to save data set on the widget.
OnLoad| The *OnLoad* message is sent when your widget is created and enables the widget to retrieve data saved on the widget.

For the most basic example, only the OnPaint() handler is required.


	widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCircle

	metadata title is "My Pink Circle"
	metadata author is "Benjamin Beaumont"
	metadata version is "1.0.0"

	public handler OnPaint()
	   // Draw widget
	end handler

	end widget


#### Draw a Pink Circle

	widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCircle

	metadata title is "My Pink Circle"
	metadata author is "Benjamin Beaumont"
	metadata version is "1.0.0"

	use com.livecode.canvas

	public handler OnPaint()
	   // Create a path with a radius of half the width of the canvas
	   // Set the paint to a solid pink color
	   // Fill the path
	   variable tCirclePath as Path
	   put circle path centered at point [my width / 2, my height / 2] with radius (my width/2) into tCirclePath
	   set the paint of this canvas to solid paint with color [1, 0, 1]
	   fill tCirclePath on this canvas
	end handler

	end widget

#### Test the Code

Now open the extension builder stack as shown above and click on the 
folder icon at the top right to load your ***.lcb*** file into the builder.

![enter image description here](images/extensions-widget-first.png)

Click test. Your widget should be displayed on the new stack. If you can't see it, check 
behind the extension stack.

#### Properties
In order to make a widget useful to end users it is likely that you'll want to expose 
properties that allow them to specify how your widget should behave. 

To specify a property you must provide a name and the method to get and set the property.

	property <name> get <variable/handler> set <variable/handler>

The simplest properties to get/set are numbers or strings. So lets create a circleMargin 
property that allows users to define a margin.

	property circleMargin get mMargin set setMargin

In the above example, when the ***circleMargin*** property is requested, the variable 
"mMargin" is returned, when set, the handler "setMargin" is called. To have LiveCode 
Builder handle the getting/setting of data, provide the variable name, to take full 
control over the getting/setting process define handlers. In our case we're taking a mixed 
approach.

	private variable mMargin as Real


We'll define a member variable to store the value for the margin. LiveCode Builder is typed 
so you must also specify the type of your variable. Remember, the canvas you are drawing 
to has subpixel precision so our margin can be a decimal number. As a result, we've chosen 
to specify our margin as a real number. For a full list of types available in LiveCode 
Builder please see the Typing section of the language specification guide. 
We also suggest a naming convention for variables in the section on 
variable and case sensitivity.

We also need to insatiate our circleMargin to a default value. We do this by adding an 
OnCreate handler which is called when the widget is first created.

	public handler OnCreate() 
		put 0 into mMargin
	end handler
	
Finally we have to implement our `setMargin` handler.

	public handler setMargin(in pMargin as Real) returns nothing
		put pMargin into mMargin
		redraw all
	end handler

Implementing the "setter" ourselves provides us with a little more flexibility. In this 
case when the property is set we want our pink circle to immediately redraw to reflect the 
property change. We do this by calling "redraw all".

To test the property click "test" and from the message box set the property.

	set the cicleMargin of widget 1 to 15

**Full Example**

	widget community.livecode.beaumont.pinkCircle

	metadata title is "My Pink Circle"
	metadata author is "Benjamin Beaumont"
	metadata version is "1.0.0"

	use com.livecode.canvas
	use com.livecode.widget
	use com.livecode.engine

	// Properties
	property circleMargin get mMargin set setMargin

	// Local variables
	private variable mMargin as Real

	public handler onCreate() 
		put 0 into mMargin
	end handler

	public handler OnPaint()
	   // Create a path with a radius of half the width of the canvas
	   // Set the paint to a solid pink color
	   // Fill the path
	   variable tCirclePath as Path
	   put circle path centered at point [my width / 2, my height / 2] with radius ((my width - mMargin)/2) into tCirclePath
	   set the paint of this canvas to solid paint with color [1, 0, 1]
	   fill tCirclePath on this canvas
	end handler

	public handler setMargin(in pMargin as Real)
		put pMargin into mMargin
		redraw all
	end handler
	
	end widget

#### Loading and Saving widget data
When your widget is created you are sent an *OnSave* message. It has the following structure 
and expects and array return type. You can fill this array with whatever widget data you 
have. LiveCode saves this data along with instances of the widget in the stack file.

	public handler OnSave(out rProperties as Array)
		put the empty array into rProperties
	
		put mMargin into rProperties["margin"]
	
		return rProperties
	end handler

This same array will be returned to you when the widget is next opened.

	public handler OnLoad(in pProperties as Array)
		put pProperties["margin"] into mMargin
	end handler

#### Understanding Error Messages
Clicking on the "test" button causes the extension builder to compile your source code 
file (***.lcb***) and produce a compiled module file (***.lcm***). If an error is 
encountered it is output in the "console" section of the builder:

	Error: <source path>: <line number>: <char number>: <error message>

* *source path* - The path the .lcb file that is being compiled
* *line number* - The line number in the script on which the error occurred.
* *char number* - The character number on which the error occurred. 
* *error message* - The description of the error.

#### LiveCode Builder API
To start creating more complex widgets see the LiveCode Builder api in the documentation 
stack in the IDE.

![enter image description here](images/extensions-canvas-docs.png)

1. Open the dictionary (and stay in the 'API' tab)
2. Click the drop-down button
3. Choose the "LiveCode Builder" API
4. The list of all the syntax available

### Creating Libraries
A extension library is written in much the same way as the above widget. The only 
difference is that all the public handlers implemented are loaded into the engine on 
startup.

### Loading and Creating Widgets Manually
To load a compiled library file call:

	load extension <filepath.lcm>

To create a widget from script call:

	create widget <name> as <identifier>

e.g.

	create widget "myWidget" as "com.livecode.extensions.waddingham.clock" 

### Composed Widgets
Widgets can either be 'host' widgets, as in the previous example, created when a widget 
is directly embedded in a stack, or 'child' widgets which are created when a widget is 
used as a child widget within another widget.
The syntax for composed widgets is included in the com.livecode.widget module.

#### A simple composed widget
This composed widget example composes the clock widget and the selector widget, to create 
a version of the clock widget with adjustable time zone.
![enter image description here](images/extensions-composed.png)
The label at the top of the widget reflects which portion of the widget the mouse is over.

	widget com.livecode.extensions.example.simplecomposed

	use com.livecode.canvas
	use com.livecode.widget

	metadata title is "Simple Composed Widget"
	metadata author is "LiveCode"
	metadata version is "1.0.0"

	private variable mInsideChild as String
	private variable mInside as Boolean

	private variable mSelector as Widget
	private variable mClock as Widget

	public handler OnCreate()
		put false into mInside
		put the empty string into mInsideChild

		put a new widget "com.livecode.extensions.livecode.selector" into mSelector
		set property "numSelections" of mSelector to 6
		set annotation "Name" of mSelector to "Selector"

		put a new widget "com.livecode.extensions.livecode.clock" into mClock
		set annotation "Name" of mClock to "Clock"

		place mSelector
		place mClock
	end handler
	
	end widget

Notice that Widget is a variable type. This widget stores references to its child widgets 
in private variables. In the `OnCreate` handler, the widget objects are created, stored 
in the private variables and 'placed'. Child widgets can be stored as variables and 
manipulated without actually being drawn to a canvas if they are unplaced.
Properties implemented by child widgets can be got and set using the 
`property <propName> of <child widget>` syntax.
Placing a widget ensures that they are drawn, in placement order. Setting an annotation of 
a child widget assigns it a tag so that when an unknown child widget is returned by an 
operator, its annotation can be used to identify it.

	public handler OnMouseEnter()
		put true into mInside
	
		if the target is not nothing then
			put annotation "Name" of the target into mInsideChild
		end if

		redraw all
	end handler

	public handler OnMouseLeave()
		if the target is not nothing then
			put the empty string into mInsideChild
		end if

		put false into mInside

		redraw all
	end handler

In the *OnMouseEnter* and *OnMouseLeave* handlers, *the target* is used to obtain a 
reference to the child widget that triggered the *OnMouseEnter* and *OnMouseLeave* events, 
and the previously assigned annotation put into the `mInsideChild` variable, which in turn 
is rendered to the canvas in the *OnPaint* handler.

	public handler OnPaint()
		set the paint of this canvas to solid paint with color [0.75, 0.75, 0.75]
		fill rectangle path of my bounds on this canvas
	
		if mInside then
			set the paint of this canvas to solid paint with color [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
			set the stroke width of this canvas to 4.0
			stroke rectangle path of my bounds on this canvas
		end if
	
		if mInsideChild is not the empty string then
			set the paint of this canvas to solid paint with color [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
			fill text mInsideChild at top of my bounds on this canvas
		end if
	end handler

The rectangle of each child widget is controlled using the following syntax:
* ```the rectangle of <widget>``` - Enables manipulation of the rectangle property of a child widget.
* ```the width of <widget>``` - Enables manipulation of the width property of a child widget.
* ```the height of <widget>``` - Enables manipulation of the height property of a child widget.
* ```the location of <widget>``` - Enables manipulation of the location property of a child widget.

	public handler OnGeometryChanged()
		set the rectangle of mSelector to rectangle [ 0, 20, my width, 50 ]
		set the rectangle of mClock to rectangle [ 0, 50, my width, my height ]
	end handler

Finally, messages posted by child widgets can be handled in the direct parent by handling 
the appropriate message (prepending 'On'). For example, the selector widget posts 
*optionChanged* when one of its numbers is selected. This is handled by this composed 
widget example in an *OnOptionChanged* handler.

	public handler OnOptionChanged(in pIndex)
		set property "timeZone" of mClock to pIndex - 1
	end handler

### Documenting Your Extension

Extensions can provide an API (Dictionary) and User Guide as part of the installed package. 
They are installed and viewable through the LiveCode Dictionary stack.

**API (Dictionary)**

![enter image description here](images/extensions-documentation.png)

1. Open the documentation stack from the menubar
2. API chooser - Choose which API to view. By default, LiveCode 8.0 comes with the LiveCode Script API and the new LiveCode Builder API. Any extension that contains an API is displayed here.
3. Category Filter - Click on the tags to filter the API entries. 
4. Search Filter - Enter a text string to filter the API entries by a specific search string
5. History - Move back and forward through your API navigation history
6. Entry List - Select the entry to display from this list
7. Entry - The entry describing the syntax

**User Guide**

![enter image description here](images/extensions-guides.jpg)

1. Click on the "Guide" tab at the top of the documentation stack
2. Select the guide you wish to view

> Note: In LiveCode 8.0 we'll be including an updated version of the LiveCode Script User 
Guide. The version currently included with LiveCode has not yet been updated.

#### Adding API Markup
Any extension can include an API. To do so, either add a file called *api.lcdoc* to your 
widget folder alongside the other widget files or markup your source code inline.

Marking up your scripts is simple and follows a similar model to other documentation formats.

Consider the following handler

	public handler myHandler(in pString as String, in pNumber as Number)
	   # Code 
	end handler

To add an entry to the API for this handler, place a formatted comment above the handler 
definition:

	/*
	summary: Use this handler to do an action
	pString: This parameter does x
	pNumber: This parameter does y
	description:
	# Markdown Title
	Here is a full description in markdown for how this function works. Once again, any GitHub 
	flavoured markdown is accepted.
	*/
	public handler myHandler(in pString as String, in pNumber as Number)
	   # Code 
	end handler

The LiveCode API parser will combine the comment items with other data pulled directly 
from your handler definition such as name, type and some parameter details.

For a full list of acceptable documentation elements please see the LiveCode Documentation
Format guide.

> **Important:** Documentation is only added to the LiveCode dictionary when a full 
extension package is installed. Currently, this is only possible through the extension
builder.

#### Adding a User Guide
Any extension can include a user guide. To do so, add a markdown file called *guide.md* 
to your widget folder alongside the other widget files.

All GitHub flavoured markdown is accepted.

### Packaging Extensions
Packaging extensions is easy. Simply open the "Extension Builder" stack:

	Tools > Extension Builder

Load your ***.lcb*** file and click "Build Package". A new file will appears in the same 
directory as your main file with the extension ***.lce***. This is your final package file 
ready for upload to the extensions portal.

#### Package requirements
A valid package can be built from a minimum set of files:

	widget.lcb // Widget source file
	support/icon.png // 20x40 png image
	support/icon@extra-high.png // 40x80 png image

## The Extension Store

Once you have created and packaged your extension you can make it available to the LiveCode Community via the [Extension Store](https://livecode.com/products/extensions), in the [widgets](https://livecode.com/products/widgets/) section.

### Registering as an Extension Developer

The first step is to [register](https://livecode.com/account/developer/register) as an Extension Developer.

- Log in to your LiveCode Account
- Select the Register option under the Developer section

![enter image description here](images/extensions-developer_id.png)

LiveCode Extensions must have unique identifiers. These identifiers use reverse domain notation.

You can sign up on this page for a LiveCode Community Developer ID. Having a developer ID will allow you to use extension identifiers of the form: `community.livecode.developerID.extensionName`.

Choose the Developer ID you want to use here. If your chosen ID is already in use you will be asked to choose a different one.

### Uploading Extensions to the Store

To upload a packaged extension to the store log in to your LiveCode account and go to the [Extensions](https://livecode.com/account/developer/extensions) section of the Developer area.

Any extensions you have uploaded will be shown here, and you have the option to add new extensions.

- Click the "Add New Extension" button (if available)
- Drag your packaged extension (`.lce`) file into the upload area
- When the extension has uploaded it will appear in your list

![enter image description here](images/extensions-upload.png)

### Activating your Extension

When an extension is first uploaded it is not active so will not show in the Extension Store.

To activate your extension click "activate" under Status. At this stage you will be warned if any information is missing and you can add it by clicking the "Edit" button.

![enter image description here](images/extensions-activate.png)

Once your extension is activated its status will change to "Active".

### The Extension Store in the Extension Manager

You can view and downlaod extensions via the Extension Store. To see the extensions that are available to download open the Extension Manager from the LiveCode Tools menu and select the "Store" tab.

![enter image description here](images/extensions-store.png)

You can also download extensions from the [Widget Store](https://livecode.com/products/widgets/) on the LiveCode website then install the downloaded extension using the Extension Manager.

## Other ways to extend the Built-in Capabilities

There are many other ways to extend LiveCode. This section explains how to run shell 
commands, start other applications, read and write to processes, execute AppleScript, 
VBScript, send and respond to AppleEvents and communicate between multiple LiveCode-based 
processes. It also tells you where to get information to create external commands and 
functions (code written in lower level languages).

### Communicating with other process and applications

#### Reading and writing to the command shell

Use the **shell** function to run shell commands and return the result. The following 
example displays a directory listing on Mac OS X:

	answer shell("ls")

And this example stores a directory listing in a variable on Windows:

	put shell("dir") into tDirectory

On Windows systems you can prevent a terminal window from being displayed by setting the 
**hideConsoleWindows** global property to true.

You can choose a different shell program by setting the **shellPath** global property. By 
default this is set to "/bin/sh" on Mac OS X and Linux and "command.com" on Windows.

> **Tip:** The shell function blocks LiveCode until it is completed. If you want to run a 
shell command in the background, write the shell script to a text file then execute it 
with the `launch`command.

#### Launching other applications

Use the **launch** command to launch other applications, documents or URLs. To launch an 
application, supply the full path to the application. The following example opens a text 
document with TextEdit on OS X:

	launch "/Users/someuser/Desktop/text document.rtf" with "/Applications/TextEdit.app"

> **Tip:** To get the path to an application, use the `answer file` command to select the 
application then copy it into your script. Run this in the message box: 
`answer file "Select an application"; put it`

To open a document with the application it is associated with use the **launch document** 
command.

	launch document "C:/My document.pdf"

To open a URL in the default web browser, use the **launch URL** command.

	launch URL "<http://www.livecode.com/>"

For more information on launching URLs and details on how to render web pages within 
LiveCode, see the Transferring Information guide.

#### Closing another application

Use the **kill process** command to send a signal to another application, to close it or 
to force it to exit. For more details, see the LiveCode Dictionary.

#### Communicating with other processes

Use the **open process** command to open an application or process you want to read and 
write data from. You can then read from the process with the **read from process** command 
and write to it with the **write to process** command. To close a process you have opened, 
use the **close process** command. The **openProcesses** returns a list of processes you 
have opened and the **openProcessIDs** returns the process IDs of each one. For more 
details see the *LiveCode Dictionary*.

#### Using AppleScript and VBScript (Open Scripting Architecture or Windows Scripting Host)

To execute commands using AppleScript on Mac OS or VBScript on Windows, use the **do as** 
command. **do as** also allows you to use any other *Open Scripting Architecture* languages 
on Mac OS or languages installed into the *Windows Scripting Host* on Windows. To retrieve 
a list of the available installed languages, use the **alternateLanguages**.

For example, to execute an AppleScript that brings the Finder on OS X to the front, enter 
the following into a field:

*tell application "Finder"*
*activate*
*end tell*

Then run:

	do field 1 as "appleScript"

To retrieve a result from commands executed using `do as`, use `the result` function. Any 
error message will also be returned in `the result`. The following example displays 
`the result` of an addition performed using VBScript:

	do "result = 1 + 1" as "vbscript"
	answer the result

For more information on the do as command, see the LiveCode Dictionary.

#### AppleEvents

To send an AppleEvent, use the **send to program** command.

If LiveCode receives an AppleEvent it will send an **appleEvent** message to the current 
card. Intercept this message to perform actions such as handling a request to quit your 
application or opening a document. The following example shows how you could handle a 
request to quit:

	on appleEvent pClass, pID, pSender
		if pClass & pID is "aevtquit" then
		-- call a function that prompts the user to save changes
		put checkSaveChanges() into tOkToQuit
		-- returns false if the user presses "cancel"
		if tOkToQuit is true then quit
		else exit appleEvent
		end if
	end appleEvent

To retrive additional information passed with the appleEvent use the 
**request appleEvent data** command. The following example shows how you could handle a 
request to open a stack:

	on appleEvent pClass, pID, pSender
		--appleEvent sent when stack is opened from the finder
		if pClass & pID is " aevtodoc " then
			-- get the file path(s)
			request AppleEvent data
			put it into tFilesList
			repeat for each line l in tFilesList
				go stack l

#### Using Local sockets

If you want to communicate between local applications a common technique that can be used 
without code changes on all the platforms LiveCode supports, is to open a local socket and 
communicate using that. You should choose a port number that is not used by a standard 
protocol – typically a high number.

This technique is commonly used when you want to create multiple programs that run 
independently but communicate with each other. It is a viable technique for running 
background tasks and provides a straightforward way to create an application that behaves 
as if threaded – i.e. with benefits of multiple threads. You can design your application 
such that additional instances can be launched to perform processing, data transfer or 
other intensive activities. Modern OSes will allocate each application to an appropriate 
processor core. By using socket messaging to communicate with each one you can keep your 
main application's user interface responsive and display status information. The following 
example shows you how to open a socket to the local machine:

	open socket to "127.0.0.1:10000" with message gotConnection

A detailed discussion of how to create a protocol using sockets can be found in the 
Transferring Information guide.

> **Tip:** To simplify communication between multiple LiveCode programs, consider writing 
a simple library that sends and receives a handler name together with parameter data. To 
call a handler in the other LiveCode program, send the handler name and data to the 
library. The library will send the data over a socket. In the receiving program intercept 
the incoming data from the socket and use it to call the appropriate message with the 
parameter data received.

## Externals – code written in lower level languages

LiveCode provides an external interface which allows you to extend it using a lower level 
language (often C). For example, if you have preexisting code that performs processing in 
a lower level language, you can write a user interface in LiveCode and then call this 
library by writing a simple wrapper around it using LiveCode's externals interface. 
LiveCode supports transmitting data to and from externals, as well as drawing into image 
objects within LiveCode windows, manipulating the player object, and more.

> **Note:** Some aspects of the built in functionality are supplied in the form of 
externals. These include the SSL library, the database library, the revBrowser library, 
zip library, video grabber and XML libraries. These libraries can be included in a 
standalone application, or excluded if they are not needed – saving disk space.
