# Working with Media

## Introduction

One of the most popular uses for LiveCode is to create full blown
multimedia applications. Even if you aren't creating a traditional
multimedia application, many applications require a compelling user
interface.

This chapter details LiveCode's media support. We discuss the image
features and capabilities: how to import and export images in a variety
of formats, how to manipulate images within LiveCode, working with
masks, the clipboard and screen capture, right through to animated GIFs.
We detail the vector graphic features and explain how to manipulate
vector graphics by script. We then cover the video and audio feature
set. Then we show you how to create custom themed buttons. Finally we
given an overview of the support for visual transition effects.

## Bitmap Images

LiveCode supports a wide variety of image formats, including the popular
PNG and JPEG formats. PNG images are space efficient and have full
support for alpha channels. JPEG images are good for displaying photos.
For more details see the table below.

| Format| Export| Mask | Comments |
|------------|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PNG**    | Yes        | Yes, 1-bit or alpha channel | Supports gamma adjustment, supports alpha channels, supports interlacing                         |
| **JPEG**   | Yes        | No                          | Supports progressive JPEGs; lossy compression. Export allows you to set the level of compression |
| **GIF**    | Yes        | 1-bit                       | GIF87a and GIF89a; supports animation; supports interlaced GIFs; maximum 256 colors              |
| **BMP**    | No         | No                          | Uncompressed                                                                                     |
| **PBM**    | Yes        | No                          | 1-bit (black and white)                                                                          |
| **PGM**    | No         | No                          | Grayscale                                                                                        |
| **PPM**    | No         | No                          |                                                                                                  |
| **XBM**    | No         | No                          |                                                                                                  |
| **XPM**    | No         | No                          | 1-bit (black and white)                                                                          |
| **XWD**    | No         | No                          |                                                                                                  |
| **PICT**   | No         | No                          | uncompressed                                                                                     |

As you can see from the table above, a number of the supported image
formats can also be exported by LiveCode.

You can modify images using LiveCode's paint tools, or manipulate the
binary data by script or using an external.

You can create images from any of LiveCode's native objects, including
buttons, fields and graphics. These can then been exported in a number
of formats. You can copy images from the clipboard or export images to
the clipboard.

LiveCode can capture a portion of the screen, or the entire screen.

### Importing Images

To import an image, choose File -\> Import As Control -\> Image File.
Select the image file you want to import. This will import the image
file into a new image object on the current card. This is equivalent to
executing the **import paint** command in the Message Box.

> **Note:** If you want to reuse an image throughout your application,
> for example as part of a custom skin for your application, create a
> substack and import all your images into that. You can then reference
> them throughout your stack file. For more information, see the section
> Creating Custom Skins, below.

### Importing Referenced Images

To reference an image file on disk choose File -\> New Referenced
Control -\> Image File. This creates an image object on the current card
and sets its **fileName** property to the path of the image file you
selected. Referenced images do not expand the size of your stack and are
only loaded from disk into memory when you navigate to the current card
or otherwise display them on screen. Referenced images are ideal where
you want to update the image in an image editor and see the changes in
LiveCode without having to re-import.

You may wish to consider creating a folder next to your stack file to
contain image files then using the Inspector to modify the file path to
the image to be a referenced path. This allows you to move the stack and
folder of images together onto a different system. for more information
on referenced file paths, see the section *File Name Specifications and
Paths*.

You can use the standalone builder to copy referenced images into a
directory (updating each image's **fileName** property) or to copy
referenced images into your stack. For more information see the chapter
*Deploying your Application*.

> **Important:** You cannot use the paint tools or manipulate the binary
> data of referenced images. You must import them first. If you want to
> modify the original file, you can make changes then export the image –
> see below for more details.

### Import using Screen Capture

To import an image by capturing a portion of the screen, choose File -\>
Import As Control -\> Snapshot. Select the region of the screen you want
to import.

To take a screen capture by script, use the **import snapshot** command.
To specify a section of the screen to import from without displaying the
crosshairs use **import snapshot from rect**:

	import snapshot from 100,100,200,200

This will create an image object on the current card from the
rectangular area specified.

### Creating Images

To create an image, drag an image object from the Tools palette to your
stack. You may now paint on the image using the paint tools, set the
`fileName`reference to an image or manipulate the binary data of the
image.

### Using the Paint Tools

To access the paint tools, press the fold out triangle at the bottom
right of the Tools palette.

To magnify an image, right click it with the pointer tool and choose
Magnify from the menu.

When you edit an image, it will be recompressed into the format
specified by the **paintCompression** global property.

### Scripting with the Paint Tools

Painting by script can be useful if you want the user to be able to see
each paint action. If you want to manipulate the data of an image more
efficiently off screen, see the next section.

To control the paint tools by script, create an image then choose the
paint tool you want to use. Set the appropriate brush, pattern or line
size then use the drag command to paint.

The following example creates an image, chooses the brush tool, selects
a small circular brush shape, selects a red color, then draws a line:

	-- set the size of the image 
	set the rect of the templateImage to 100,100,400,400 
	create image 
	choose brush tool 
	set the brush to 8 
	set the brushColor to red -- could use an RGB triplet here 
	set the dragSpeed to 20 -- very slow 
	drag from 120,120 to 300,300

For more information, see the entries for the **templateImage**,
**tool**, **brush**, **brushColor**, **brushPattern**, **dragSpeed**,
**penColor** and **penPattern** in the *LiveCode Dictionary*.

You may reduce the size of an image using the **crop** command.

You may rotate an image using the **rotate** command.

To adjust the quality of the scaling algorithm used when scaling an
image, set the **resizeQuality** property before setting the image's
rect.

### Manipulating Binary Image Data

To manipulate the binary data of an image, use the image's **imageData**
property. This property returns the color and transparency value of each
pixel in the image in a consistent format regardless of the format the
image is saved in. The **imageData** is stored as binary, with each 
pixel represented by 4 bytes. To convert it to and from RGB values use 
the **byteToNum** and **numToByte** functions.

For example, the numeric value of the red, green and blue channels 
respectively for the tenth pixel are given by the expressions:

	charToNum(char (4 * 9 + 2 of the imageData of image <image>)
	charToNum(char (4 * 9 + 3 of the imageData of image <image>)
	charToNum(char (4 * 9 + 4 of the imageData of image <image>)

To manipulate the binary data of an image using an external, use the
**imagePixMapID** property.

When you set the **imageData** of an image the image will be 
recompressed into the format specified by the **paintCompression** 
global property.

### Rendering an Image from Objects

Use the **import snapshot** command to create an image from objects or a
region of a stack. Instead of specifying a rectangle in global
coordinates (as described above) specify a stack or object.

> **Note:** Unlike screen capturing, the stack or object you specify to
> import an image from does not need to be displayed on screen. You can
> create a layout off screen in an invisible stack then render it into
> an image.
 
To import a snapshot of a region of a stack:

	import snapshot from 100,100,200,200 of stack "Layout"

To import a snapshot of an object:

	import snapshot from button 5 of stack "objects"

The import snapshot command creates a new image in the current
**defaultStack**. The image is encoded using the current
**paintCompression** format.

To save this snapshot directly to a file instead of creating an image,
use the export snapshot command: 

	export snapshot from the selectedObject to file "snap.jpg" as JPEG

### Exporting Images

To export an image in the current format that it is stored in, put it
into a binary file using the URL commands. The following example prompts
the user to select a file then export the image into it:

	ask file "Select a file:" 
	put image "picture" into URL ("binfile:" & it)

To export an image in a different format, use the **export** command.

	export image "picture" to file "picture.png" as PNG

You may also export an image to a variable. See the **export** command
in the *LiveCode Dictionary* for more information.

### Copying and Pasting Images

To copy an image internally without using the system clipboard, simply
put it into a variable or into another image.

	put image 1 into image 2

To recompress the image in a different format, use the **export**
command to export it to a variable then put that variable into an image.

To copy an image to the clipboard, use the **copy** command.

	copy image 1

To paste an image from the clipboard, use the **paste** command.

To transfer the binary data of an image to and from the clipboard get
and set the **clipBoardData["image"]** property. See the 
**clipBoardData** entry in the *LiveCode Dictionary* for more 
information.

### Working with Animated GIFs

You can import an animated GIF image in the same way you import other
images.

Set the **repeatCount** property to specify how often to play the
animation. Setting the **repeatCount** to 0 pauses the animation and
setting it to -1 causes it to repeat forever.

To change the current frame set the **currentFrame** property.

> **Note:** If you use an animated GIF as a button icon, it will play
> simultaneously in each button it is used for.

## Working with Vector Graphics

In addition to bitmap graphics, LiveCode also supports vector graphics.
You can create vector graphics using the graphics tools, or by script.
You can manipulate them interactively in the IDE or by script. You can
relayer them, export a description of them or convert them to bitmap
format.

> **Tip:** Animation Engine is a 3<sup>rd</sup> party library that
> includes a set of functions for programming interactive graphic
> animations. See the Related Software section of our web site for more
> information.
> 

### The Vector Graphic Tools

To see the graphic tools, unfold the triangle at the bottom right of the
tools palette. The graphics tools are located above the paint tools on
the tools palette. The graphic tools operate in the same way as the
paint tools, except that each time you draw a shape a new graphic object
is created. Unlike paint graphics, you can resize and adjust graphic
objects after you have created them. For more information on the
individual shapes, see the section on *Paint Tools*, above.

### Creating Graphics by Script

To create graphics by script, set properties of the **templateGraphic**
then use the **create graphic** command. For more information on
template objects, see the section *Creating objects off screen using the
template objects* in Chapter 7.

### Manipulating graphics by script

Because each graphic is an individual object, you manipulate its
appearance by setting properties rather than using the drag commands (as
with the paint tools, above). You can control all properties of the
graphic object by script including the rectangle, line and fill
properties. You can change a graphic from one type to another (e.g. a
rectangle to an oval) by setting its **style** property.

The polygon style of graphic has a **points** property which allows you
to set the individual points of a line.

Simple motion can be applied using the **move** command. For example, to
move a graphic 100 pixels to the right asynchronously:

	move graphic 1 relative 100,0 without waiting

For more information, see the **move** command in the LiveCode
Dictionary.

To program a more complex animation effect, calculate the changes to the
points or rectangles and set these values using timer based messaging.
The following example scales a graphic named "rectangle" down by 100
pixels over the course of 1 second.

	local sCount
	on mouseUp 
		put 0 into sCount 
		scaleGraphic 
	end mouseUp
	
	on scaleGraphic 
		add 1 to sCount 
		if sCount > 100 then exit scaleGraphic
		get the rect of graphic "rectangle" 
		add 1 to item 1 of it 
		add 1 to item 2 of it 
		subtract 1 from item 3 of it 
		subtract 1 from item 4 of it 
		set the rect of graphic "rectangle" to it 
		send "scaleGraphic" to me in 10 milliseconds 
	end scaleGraphic

See the section on *Timer based messaging* for more information on using
timers.

## Working with Video

LiveCode supports playback of video with the player object. On Windows
*DirectShow* is supported. Media format support in the new Windows 
player control depends on which codecs are installed. A list of the
[file formats and compression types available as standard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms787745(VS.85).aspx)
on Windows is available in the MSDN documentation

On Mac OS X systems, the player object uses the AV Foundation framework.

On Linux Systems, the player object can play back video using *mplayer*.
There are some functionality limitations: the **alwaysBuffer**, 
**startTime**, **endTime**, **showController** and **playSelection** 
properties have no effect, and **play step forward**/**play step back** 
do not work reliably.

In addition to these features, LiveCode has built-in support for the
animated GIF format. Animated GIF files can be played back without
3<sup>rd</sup> party software. See above for more information. Other
formats supported by plug-ins in web browsers can be played back using
revBrowser (e.g. Flash). See the topic on *revBrowser* for more
information.

### The Player Object

Use the player object to play and interact with video and audio. To
create a player object, drag one onto your stack from the Tools palette.
To select a movie file to play, open the Inspector for the player object
and select a file to use as the source. Doing this sets the player's
**fileName** property.

To *stream* a movie from an Internet server, set the fileName property
to the URL address of the stream.

To play a player, use the **start** and **stop** commands.

	start player 1 
	stop player 1

The following table describes commonly used player properties:

| Property Name | Function | Example |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **alwaysBuffer**         | Forces the player to be buffered, allowing objects to be drawn on top and the current frame to be printed | `set the alwaysBuffer of player 1 to true`                   |

For more information on any of these terms, see the *LiveCode
Dictionary*.

## Working with Sounds

In addition to playing back sound in a wide variety of formats using the
player object, LiveCode has in-built support for playback of WAV, AIFF
and AU format audio clips.

> **Note:** We recommend you use the player object for playing audio as
> it supports a wide range of formats and compression types. Use the
> audio clip when you need basic audio playback on systems that do not
> have any of the 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries supported by the player
> object installed.

### Importing an Audio Clip

To import an audioClip choose File -\> Import as Control -\> Audio File.
This will import the selected audio file into the current stack as an
audioClip.

### Playing an Audio Clip

To play an audio clip:

	play audioClip 1

To stop playing

	play stop

To set the volume:

	-- sets the volume to 50% 
	set the playLoudness of audioclip 1 to 50

## Working with Visual Transition Effects

LiveCode supports visual transition effects when changing card or hiding
and showing objects. There are three types of effect support: built-in
effects which work on all platforms, QuickTime effects which work on
older Mac OS X systems and Core Image effects which work
on Mac OS X.

Use the **visual effect** command to display a visual effect. To go to
the next card with a dissolve transition effect:

	visual effect dissolve slow go next card

To make changes to objects on the screen with a visual effect (e.g.
hide, show or move them), first lock the screen, then make the changes,
then unlock the screen:

	lock screen 
	hide image 1 
	show image 3 
	unlock screen with visual effect "wipe right"

To choose a QuickTime effect using the effect chooser dialog use:

	answer effect 
	-- store the visual effect as a custom property 
	set the cEffect of this stack to it

Then:

	visual effect (the cEffect of this stack) 
	go next card

For more information on visual effects, see the **visual effect**
command in the *LiveCode Dictionary*. To try out the different visual
effects available in an interactive format see the [Multimedia
Workshop](http://www.runrev.com/developers/exploring-revolution/
multimedia/)

## Creating Custom Skins

In addition to its support for system native controls, LiveCode allows
you the ability to create an entirely custom look, or skin, for your
application. All of the built-in elements can be replaced with themed
graphics allowing you to create rich multimedia. For example, LiveCode
buttons support "icons" of unlimited size which can be used to replace
the native appearance of a button entirely. Windows can be irregularly
shaped and even contain holes and alpha mask (variable) transparency.
All of LiveCode's objects support a variety of transfer modes or inks.
Stacks can take over the entire screen or be displayed with a backdrop.

### Custom Themed Buttons

To create a custom button, first create a regular button. Open the
*Inspector* for the button and set its style to *Transparent*. Turn off
the *Show Name* property. Next, switch to the *Icons & Border* pane in
the Inspector. Turn off the *Hilite Border* property. You can now select
any image you have imported to use as an icon for the button. To set the
mouse down state, set the *hilite* icon. To set the roll over state set
the *hover* icon.

A button "icon" may be an image of any size in LiveCode, allowing a
completely custom look.

> **Tip:** To use the same set of images as icons throughout your stack
> file, create a substack and import all your theme images into it. Set
> the ID property of each image to a high value (between 10,000 and
> 100,000) so that it will be unique. You can now reference that image
> anywhere in your application. If you want to change theme, you only
> need to replace that image with another image and give it the same ID.

Any object in LiveCode can behave like a button. For example, if you
want to create a graphic that responds when a user clicks on it, create
the graphic and add a **mouseUp** handler to it, in the same way you 
would with a button.

### Irregular Windows

To create an irregularly shaped window, import or create an image that
has a transparency mask. Then use the *Stack Inspector* to choose that
image as the stack's *Shape*. To change the shape by script, set the
**windowShape** property. Many modern window managers support alpha
blended windows (variable degrees of transparency). To create a window
with an alpha channel, import a PNG that contains an alpha channel and
set the **windowShape** to this image.

### Blend Modes (transfer modes or inks)

Blend modes determine how an object's colors combine with the colors of
the pixels underneath the object to determine how the object's color is
displayed. To set the blend mode of an object, use the *Blending* pane
in the *Inspector* or set the object's **ink** property. All objects in
LiveCode support blend modes, with the exception of stacks.

	set the ink of image "picture" to "blendBurn"

For more information, see the **ink** entry in the LiveCode Dictionary.

To set the degree of transparency, set the object's **`blendLevel`**
property. All LiveCode objects (including stacks) support `blendLevel`:

	set the blendLevel of button 1 to 50 
	-- sets a button to 50% transparent

### Full screen mode

A stack can be displayed as full screen by setting its **fullScreen**
property to true:

	set the fullScreen of this stack to true

Set this property back to `false` to exit full screen mode.

If you want to hide or show the menu bar on Mac OS X use the **hide
menuBar** or **show menuBar** commands.

Similarly, use **hide taskbar** and **show taskbar** on Windows systems
to hide and show the taskbar.

### Displaying a Backdrop

To display a backdrop set the **backDrop** global property. You may set
the backDrop to a solid color or to the ID of an image.

	set the backDrop to "black"

To remove the **backDrop**:

	set the backDrop to none
