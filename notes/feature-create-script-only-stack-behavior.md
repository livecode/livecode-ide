# Create script only stack behavior
The menu for assigning a behavior to a control has two additional options:
- Create behavior from new script only stack
- Create behavior using control script and script only stack
Either option will prompt you for a stack name and a location for the script only stack.
The new stack will be saved, assigned as the behavior of the control, and then added
to the stackfiles property of control's stack.
