# SVG icon support in the Extension Builder

The 'Extension Builder' now displays LiveCode Builder extensions' SVG
icons, if present.  You can add an SVG icon to an LCB extension by
setting its "svgicon" metadata to an SVG path that could be displayed
by the 'SVG Icon' widget.

When an extension provides an SVG icon, packaging the extension no
longer requires you to choose bitmap icon files.
