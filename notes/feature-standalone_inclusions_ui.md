# Standalone Inclusions Interface

The standalone settings user interface has been reworked to unify the 
notion of app inclusion. There is now an 'Inclusions' pane which allows
the user to select from a complete list of available inclusions.
The list contains information about which platforms are supported.

The 'Inclusions' pane significantly improves the cross-platform development
experience provided by LiveCode (since the iOS and Android panes no 
longer have separate check boxes for the various built-in externals such
as revxml), as well as paving the way for much better extensibility in
the future.
