# Autocomplete has been added to the script editor

While typing in the script editor a filtered list of available completions
will appear below the selection. Use the following keys to navigate the
completion list:

- tab - apply the completion
- up arrow - move up the list
- down arrow - move down the list
- right arrow - move to the next placeholder field
- left arrow - close the completion list

Moving the mouse will hide the completion list to avoid it remaining in
place over an area you would like to select. Completions include
placeholder fields which you can navigate with the tab key.
