tutorial "Combining Text"

prologue
	LiveCode's uniquely powerful text handling capabilities comes in handy for a wide range of applications. Common tasks include:

	- Mail merging a form email

	- Creating a leaflet for print

	- Building an invoice
end prologue

step "Tutorial Intro 1"
	In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

	- Work with words and lines

	- Combine texts together

	- Make decisions

	- Insert variables into your output
action
	interlude
	go to step "Load stack"
end step

step "Load stack"
	Some text
action
	load lesson "App Lesson 0"
	go to step "Tutorial Intro 2"
end step

step "Tutorial Intro 2"
	In this tutorial, we will have a template email, which is placed in a field called "template", a record, which is placed in a field called "record", and an output field, which is called "output". We also have a button called "Create email".
action
	interlude
	go to step "Address by name 1"
end step

step "Address by name 1"
	We want to create a personalized email by combining the email template with the personal details in the "record" field.
action
	interlude
	go to step "Address by name 2"
end step

step "Address by name 2"
	The first step is to start our email with "Dear Mr Miller". To do this we need to add some code to the button.

	Ensure you are in 'Edit' mode and select the "Create email" button .
action
	wait until button "create" is selected
	go to step "Address by name 3"
end step

step "Address by name 3"
	Open the Script editor for the button by clicking the 'Code' button in the Toolbar.
action
		highlight toolbar "Code"
		wait until there is a script editor for button "Create"
	go to step "Address by name 4"
end step

step "Address by name 4"
	Add this handler to the button script. We will explain this line by line in a moment.

	Don't forget to click the 'Apply' button when you have finished.
script
	on mouseUp
		put field "template" into field "output"
		put field "record" into theRecord
		put line 2 of theRecord && word -1 of line 1 of theRecord & comma into theName
		put theName after line 1 of field "output"
	end mouseUp
action
	highlight script editor for button "Create"
	wait until button "Create" is scripted
	go to step "Address by name 5"
end step

step "Address by name 5"
	The first line of code puts the contents of the "template" field (our email text) into the "output" field.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "into field" of script editor for button "create"
	go to step "Address by name 6"
end step

step "Address by name 6"
	The second line of code puts the contents of the "record" field into a variable we're calling 'theRecord' - this makes it easier to work with.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "into theRecord" of script editor for button "create"
	go to step "Address by name 7"
end step

step "Address by name 7"
	The third line of code combines 3 pieces of text and puts them into another variable, 'theName'.

	- the whole of line 2 of our record (Mr)

	- then the last word of line 1 of our record (Miller)

	- then a comma

	A single ampersand '&' tells LiveCode to combine text together and a double ampersand '&& tells it insert a space when it does so.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "put line 2 of theRecord" of script editor for button "create"
	go to step "Address by name 8"
end step

step "Address by name 8"
	Finally, we put 'theName' into the "output" field, after line 1.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "put theName after" of script editor for button "create"
	go to step "Run mode 1"
end step

step "Run mode 1"
	Take a look at what this does by switching into 'Run' mode on the Tools palette. You will see a personalized email to Mr Miller in the "output" field.

	Select 'Run mode' in the Tools Palette.
action
	highlight tool "Run Mode"
	wait until the tool is run
	go to step "Test 1"
end step

step "Test 1"
	Click on the 'Create email' button to see the customized message.
action
	highlight button "create"
	wait until the text of field "output" is changed with default "Dear Mr Miller"
	go to step "Video choice 1"
end step

step "Video choice 1"
	Next we will add some more personal information to the final email.

	We want to decide whether to show section (1) or section (2) of the email. Do we want to say "We noticed you watched X videos so far" or do we want to say "We notice you haven't watched any videos so far"?

	The number of videos watched is the fifth line of the record.

action
	interlude
	go to step "Video choice 2"
end step

step "Video choice 2"
	To do this we need to add some more code to the button.

	Select 'Edit' mode in the Tools Palette.
action
	highlight tool "Edit Mode"
	wait until the tool is edit
	go to step "Video choice 2a"
end step

step "Video choice 2a"
	Select the "Create email" button.
action
	wait until button "create" is selected
	go to step "Video choice 3"
end step

step "Video choice 3"
	Open the Script editor for the button by clicking the 'Code' button in the Toolbar.
action
		highlight toolbar "Code"
		wait until there is a script editor for button "Create"
		go to step "Video choice 4"
end step

step "Video choice 4"
	Add this handler to the button script. We will explain this line by line in a moment.

	Don't forget to click the 'Apply' button when you have finished.
script
	on mouseUp
		put field "template" into field "output"
		put field "record" into theRecord
		put line 2 of theRecord && word -1 of line 1 of theRecord & comma into theName
		put theName after line 1 of field "output"

		if line 5 of theRecord > 0 then
			delete line 9 to 12 of field "output"
			put line 5 of theRecord into word 5 of line 5 of field "output"
		else
			delete line 5 to 8 of field "output"
		end if
	end mouseUp
action
	highlight script editor for button "Create"
	wait until button "Create" is scripted
	go to step "Video choice 5"
end step

step "Video choice 5"
	The first step is to check how many videos have been watched, and use an 'if statement' to execute different blocks of code depending on the number.

	- If at least one video has been watched we will use the first block of text from the template, and put the correct number of videos in the text.

	- If no videos have been watched we will use the second block of text from the template.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "if line 5 of theRecord" of script editor for button "create"
	go to step "Video choice 7"
end step

step "Video choice 7"
	If line 5 of 'theRecord' is greater than zero we know that the customer has watched some videos, so we delete lines 9 to 12 of the email, which say "We notice you haven't watched any videos so far".
action
	interlude
	highlight line "delete line 9 to 12" of script editor for button "create"
	go to step "Video choice 8"
end step

step "Video choice 8"
	Then we put line 5 of 'theRecord', the number of videos watched, into word 5 of line 5 of our email, replacing the placeholder "X" in "We noticed you watched X videos so far".
action
	interlude
	highlight line "put line 5 of theRecord" of script editor for button "create"
	go to step "Video choice 9"
end step

skip point

step "Video choice 9"
	If line 5 of 'theRecord' is 0 (or less), we delete line 5 to 8 of the output email.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "delete line 5 to 8" of script editor for button "create"
	go to step "Run mode 2"
end step

step "Run mode 2"
	Take a look at what this does by switching into 'Run' mode on the Tools palette.

	Select 'Run mode' in the Tools Palette.
action
	highlight tool "Run Mode"
	wait until the tool is run
	go to step "Test 2"
end step

step "Test 2"
	Click on the 'Create email' button to see the updated message.

	You will see that the "output" field now displays the relevant message for the number of watched videos stored in the profile.
action
	highlight button "create"
	wait until the text of field "output" is changed with default "We notice you've watched 3 videos so far."
end step

epilogue

	- Work with words and lines

	- Combine texts together

	- Make decisions

	- Insert variables into your output
