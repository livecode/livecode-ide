tutorial "Using Timers"

prologue
	In this tutorial we're going to look at using timers to update the screen. You might want to

	- Check and display the progress of a task

	- Set events and reminders

	- Draw animation
end prologue

step "Introduction"
	You'll learn to

	- Use a timer to move the seconds hand on a clock

	- Cancel timers
action
	interlude
	go to step "Load stack"
end step

step "Load stack"

action
	load lesson "App Lesson 0"
	go to step "Start button code 1"
end step

step "Start button code 1"
	The stack consists of a clock background image, a graphic used as the "seconds" hand and a "Start/Stop" button to start the seconds hand ticking.

	We will be creating the motion of the second hand by adjusting the Start angle on the "seconds" graphic to give us the effect of movement.
action
	interlude
	go to step "Start button code 2"
end step

step "Start button code 2"
	To start the seconds hand ticking we will add code to the "Start" button.

	Ensure you are in 'Edit' mode and select the "Create email" button .
action
	wait until button "start" is selected
	go to step "Start button code 3"
end step

step "Start button code 3"
		Open the Script editor for the button by clicking the 'Code' button in the Toolbar.
action
		highlight toolbar "Code"
		wait until there is a script editor for button "start"
		go to step "Start button code 4"
end step

step "Start button code 4"
	Add this handler to the button script. We'll go through the code one line at a time next.

	Don't forget to click the 'Apply' button when you have finished.
script
	local lTimerID

	on mouseUp
		if the label of me is "Start" then
			updateClock
			set the label of me to "Stop"
		else
			cancel lTimerID
			set the label of me to "Start"
		end if
	end mouseUp
action
	highlight script editor for button "start"
	wait until button "start" is scripted
	go to step "Start button code 5"
end step

step "Start button code 5"
	When the mouse is clicked, first we check that the timer isn't already running by checking the label of the button.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "if the label of me" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Start button code 6"
end step

step "Start button code 6"
	If the label of the button is "Start" we send a message 'updateClock'.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "updateClock" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Start button code 7"
end step

step "Start button code 7"
	We then set the label of the button to "Stop".
action
	interlude
	highlight line "set the label of me to" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Start button code 8"
end step

step "Start button code 8"
	If the button label is not already "Start", then we must be stopping the clock, so we cancel the timer.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "cancel lTimerID" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Start button code 9"
end step

step "Start button code 9"
	Then we change the label of the button back to "Start".
action
	interlude
	highlight line "end if" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Start button code 10"
end step


step "Start button code 10"
	Next we need to implement the updateClock message. This handler will

	- Get the seconds part of the current time

	- Calculate the angle to set the hands to

	- Set the angle of the hands

	- Tell the clock to update again in 1 second
action
	interlude
	go to step "Start button code 11"
end step

step "Start button code 11"
	Add this handler to the button script. We'll go through the code one line at a time next.

	Don't forget to click the 'Apply' button when you have finished.
script
	local lTimerID

	on mouseUp
		if the label of me is "Start" then
			updateClock
			set the label of me to "Stop"
		else
			cancel lTimerID
			set the label of me to "Start"
		end if
	end mouseUp

	on updateClock
		set the itemDel to ":"
		put word 1 of item 3 of the long time into theSeconds
		put 360 - (theSeconds - 15) * 6 into theAngle
		set the startAngle of graphic "seconds" to theAngle

		send "updateClock" to me in 1 second
		put the result into lTimerID
	end updateClock
action
	highlight script editor for button "start"
	wait until button "start" is scripted
	go to step "Start button code 12"
end step

step "Start button code 12"
	 First, we set the item delimiter - the character used to separate items in our string - to colon. This is because time is formatted separated by a colon e.g.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "set the itemDel to" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Start button code 13"
end step

step "Start button code 13"
	Then we put word 1 of item 3 of the long time (fetched from the system) into a variable, 'theSeconds'. The long time is formatted as

	12:50:15 PM

	Item 3 is "15 PM", so word 1 of item 2 gives us the seconds part.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "put word 1 of item 3" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Start button code 14"
end step

step "Start button code 14"
	Next we calculate the angle to set the hands to, based on the seconds variable. We put this into 'theAngle' variable.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "put 360 - (theSeconds - 15)" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Start button code 15"
end step

step "Start button code 15"
	Then we set the start angle - which exact slice of our graphic we are showing - to 'theAngle'.
action
	interlude
	highlight line "set the startAngle of graphic" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Start button code 16"
end step

step "Start button code 16"
	We want to update the timer every second so we send the 'updateClock' message again in 1 second, creating a loop.
action
	interlude
	highlight "send" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Start button code 17"
end step

step "Start button code 17"
	Finally, we put the result of all this work into a local variable, 'lTimerID', which we declared at the top of the script. This means we can use it again in the first mouseUp handler, to stop the timer as well as start it.
action
	interlude
	highlight "put the result into lTimerID" of script editor for button "start"
	go to step "Run mode"
end step

step "Run mode"
	Try is out by switching into 'Run' mode on the Tools palette.

	Select 'Run mode' in the Tools Palette.
action
	highlight tool "Run Mode"
	wait until the tool is run
	go to step "Test"
end step

step "Test 1"
	Click on the 'Start' button. You will see the seconds hand start to tick around the clock. Click it again to stop the clock.
action
	highlight button "create"
	wait until the label of button "start" is "Stop"
end step

epilogue
	Congratulations. You have learned how to

	- Use a timer to move the seconds hand on a clock

	- Cancel timers
