script "revSEVariablesFilterBehavior"

/*
The aim here is to display the text "Search variables..." in italics
when the field is not focused and there is no current filter text,
and to display the filter text in normal font otherwise.

When the content is modified, a message is sent immediately.
The following custom properties are used to configure how the
message is sent:

    cCallback       -- the message to send
    cCallbackTarget -- the long ID of the object that the message
                       should be sent to
